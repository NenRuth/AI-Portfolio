#Looping allows you to take the same action, or set of actions, with every item in a list.
#looping is important because it’s one of the most common ways a computer automates repetitive tasks.
#chefs = ['Arinze', 'Bemzy', 'Angelo', 'Rolly', 'Abass', 'Bond', 'Osondu', 'Michael', 'Mark']
#for chef in chefs:
	#print(chef)

#for chef in chefs:
	#print(chef.title() + ', that was great!')
	#print("I can't wait to experience your next dish, " + chef.title() + ".")
	#print("Once again, thank you great Chef, " + chef.title() + "\n")

#Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these
# pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
#fav_soups = ['oha', 'nsala', 'veggies', 'okro']
#for fav_soup in fav_soups:
 	#print(fav_soup.title())

# • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
# instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should
# have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni
# pizza.
	# print("Have you tried goat meat with " + fav_soup + " soup?")

# • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states
# how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines
# about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as
# I really love pizza!

#print("oh!, I really want to have one these right now!")

#  Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
# Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to
# print out the name of each animal.

#cats = ["tiger", "leopard", "lion", "chetaah"]
#for cat in cats:
	#print(cat)

# • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet.
# for cat in cats:
# 	print(cat.upper() + ', these are wild cats!')
# 	print("I can't have, " + cat + "as a pet" + "\n")
# print("Once again, keep your pet, " + cat)

# • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. 
#you could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

#Numbers: Floats(decimals), integers (whole numbers)
#add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), divide (/), exponents (**)
#str() helps python recognize int as strings. for example,
# age = 23
# message = 'Happy ' +  str(age) + 'rd '+  'birthday'
# print(message)

# print(5+3)
# print(6+2)
# print(7+1)
# print(4+4)

#DIY: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message 
# that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.
# age = 33
# message = "At " + str(age) + "," + " I have 4 kids, hold a Master's degree, pursuing a Doctorate, and own a property in FCT."
# print(message)

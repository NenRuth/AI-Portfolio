#print ("hello world!")
#print ('how are you today?!')
#print ('I am back!. Did you miss me?!')

#variables: every variable hold a value. The variable here is message. 
# message = 'I am back!. Did you miss me?!'
# print(message)
# message = 'I hope to be very committed this time, no jokes here!'
# print (message)
# status = 'OMG, I am already tired. I think I need some sleep'
# print(status)

#Strings: these are words or sentence, and must be enclosed inside 
# a "" or '' Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python. for example
# 'she is cute'
# "I am runing late for the show"

# name = 'ezeh ruth'
# print(name.title())
# print(name.upper())
# print(name.lower()) 

# concatenation: the method of combining strings. + is used to combine strings. for example:
# first_name = 'ruth'
# last_name = 'ezeh'
# full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  #the " " is used for spacing.
# print(full_name)
# print(full_name.title())

# print('hello!, ' + full_name)
# print('hello!, ' + 'my name is ' + full_name.title() + '!')
# message = 'hello!, ' + 'my name is ' + full_name.title() + '!'
# print(message)

#whitespace: a character used for spacing and has an empty representation.
#in python, the xters, /t and \n are used before the strings for spacing. 
#To add a tab to your text, use the character combination \t, for example
# print('My God have been keeping me')
# print('\t He is ever faithful!')
#To add a newline in a string, use the character combination \n

# print('My God have been keeping me')
# print('\nHe is ever faithful!')
# print('Languages I can speak include: \nIgbo: proficient\nEnglish: proficient\nSpanish: beginner')
# print('Languages I can speak include: \n\tIgbo: proficient\n\tEnglish: proficient\n\tSpanish: beginner')

# .lstrip() strip(): .rstrip()
